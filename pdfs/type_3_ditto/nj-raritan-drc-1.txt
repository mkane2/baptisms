position of the Editor of the QuarTERLY. Another copy is in the pos-
session of the Holland Society of New York City. The Wyckoff record
the Editor expects to copy with care and then compare with the original
record, to make sure there are no omissions, and to try to verify the
peculiar spellings not always certain, and in this will have the
cheerful and valued co-operation of the present pastor of the church,
Rev. Wm. Stockton Cranmer, D. D. An exact chronological order will
be followed. In the original the childs name appears first and then the
parents, but, for purposes of reference, the parents are now printed first,
and then the name of the child.

Until about 1727 the sponsors, or witnesses, to baptisms were gener-
ally noted in the baptismal book, and, as these are important, often show-
ing family relationships and giving names not appearing elsewhere, they
will be included in the published record. After 1727 the names of wit-
nesses appear only at infrequent intervals.

It should be noted by those who refer to the records as now printed
that surnames ending in se or sen were so written, indifferently, and
sometimes s only with or without a flourish after it as an example in
the latter case, Cornelis Powels for Cornelis Powelsen. Also that the
relationship of the sponsors is often uncertain, even when the word vrow
wife appears followed by another surname. For example, Johannes
Sebrige and vrou Merledt. This may mean Sebriges wife was a Mer-
ledt, or it may mean the wife of a Merledt was the second witness. We
do not undertake in such cases to go beyond the record, but shall give
them as written, so far as possible.

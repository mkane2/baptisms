all Americans to ye God of armies.
18. Saturday—Mr. Taylor, a spy, lately taken in
Little Britain, was hung here. The Rev. Mr. Romain
and myself attended him yesterday, and I have spent
the morning in discoursing to him, and attended him
at ye gallows. He did not appear to be either a poiit_
ical or gospel penitent.

[These 69 baptisms were entered during the ministry of John
Peter Miller. The chirography is that of a well educated man
and the natural inference is that Mr. Miller himself made these
entries. His ministry at Goshenhoppen is placed beyond doubt by
the letters of Mr. Boehm, quoted above (see p. 79). His state-
ments are supported by the fact that in the 26th baptism, on April
16, 1732, Johann Peter Muller acted as sponsor (see p. 278), a
role which the pastor frequently fdled in early times. Cf. the 56th
baptism of Mr. Goetschy (see p. 2S4), and the 8th baptism of
Frederick Casimir Muller (see p. 286).]

[These 25 children were baptized by the Rev. Peter Henry
Dorsius, of Xehaminy, Bucks County. The entries were not made
by him, but are in a wretched scrawl, made perhaps by one of the
ciders. The letters of Mr. Boehm, quoted above (seep. 137). make
it cv.dent that Mr. Dorsius was in Goshenhoppen, both before as
well as after his journey to Holland, which took place from May,
t743. to January, 1744. The presence of Mr. Dorsius at Goshen-
hoppen on May 6, 1744, is also vouched for by Mr. Boehm (see
(p. 142). On the previous day he baptized the last six children.]

[These 35 entries (except one or two) are in the wretched, but
well-known handwriting of Frederick Casimir Miller. His pres-
ence is also vouched for by the eighth and ninth baptisms, which con-
tain his name. As the entries of Rev. Weiss began in 1747 (see
p. 301), the ministry of A I ill er seems to have extended from 174.5
to 1747. But the later entries prove that he made occasional visits
to Goshenhoppen and baptized children there as late as April 2S,
1750. As the record remained in the hands of his followers, he
was able to make these later entries. Cf. the following note ot
Weiss on p. 37.]

CHURCH RECORD OF THE GREAT SWAMP
REFORMED CONGREGATION, LOWER
MILFORD TOWNSHIP, LEHIGH
CO., PA., 1736-1S33.
Translated ey Prof. Wm. J. Hinke, Ph.D.
Church Record
of the Christian Congregation at
Great Swamp,
In which are recorded: First, the articles of the Christian Church Order,
which this Congregation (together with others in this land) has adopted.
Secondly, the names of the children that have been baptized, their parents
and their sponsors.
The beginning was made in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1736,
the 24th of April.
Joh. Henricus Goetschius,
V. D. M. Helvetico-Tigurinus.
Memorandum of the Articles of the Church Order.
1. Four elders, honorable men, who have a good report among their
neighbors, shall he named by the minister and be elected by the majority
of the voters. Each shall remain in office for two years.
The Duty of the Elders shall be:
a. To exercise good oversight over the members of the congregation and
to make known everything disorderly, (1) to the minister alone; (2) to
the minister and the other elders; (3) to the whole congregation, if the
first and second admonition had no effect, in order that those who give
public offense may not be tolerated in the congregation of God.
4.f7
The Pennsylvania-German Society.43S
b. The youngest of them shall take up the collection for one year, the
next to the youngest the following year, at every divine service. One of
them shall collect the amount and keep it faithfully until the time of
accounting, which shall take place every half year before the whole con-
gregation.
Expenditure of the Alms.
The collections or alms shall be expended as follows:
a. They shall be applied to needy persons who may be in or outside of
the congregation.
b. To the church or schoolhouse, if there is anything to improve or to
build.
c. For bread and wine at the communion service,
Or whatever else may be found to be a necessary expenditure in the
judgment of the Christian congregation.
The Second Article, regarding the Congregation:
1. Every one who confesses the Evangelical Reformed religion and
wishes to belong to this congregation shall make a solemn vow before God
and men, and faithfully promise by the signature of his own name, that
he and his household will be obedient to every divine ordinance. Other-
wise he shall not be regarded as a Christian member, but shall be ex-
cluded from all gifts and privileges which the members of this congrega-
tion enjoy.
2. Each one shall contribute every year, according to his pleasure and
ability, whatever will be necessary for the maintenance of the divine
worship.
3. Should any member or those of his family lead offensive lives and
will not show amendment of life through the preaching of God’s Word
or private admonition, he can expect exclusion from the Lord's Supper and
even from the congregation.

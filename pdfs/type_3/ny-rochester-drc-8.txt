COCHECTON

Have you seen the vale Cochecton, where the hemlock-

waters run,

When the mist is on the mountain, at the rising of the sun ?

There, like smiles of joyous woman, laughs the rippling

Delaware,

And the sunbeams kiss the wavelets, and the mists of upper

air.

There the light song of the raftsman echoes through the

vocal hills,

And the music of bright nature answers from the gushing

rills.

There the stag with scornful bearing, snuffs the perfume of

the breeze,

And the dew-drops sparkle brightly on the flowers and on

the trees.

Oh ! if there is peace 'neath Heaven, sure her calm abode

is here :

May my life flow ever onward, gentle stream, like thy

career.

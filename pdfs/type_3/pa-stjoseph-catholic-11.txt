they fail contrary, however, to what appears their hitherto uniform
custom to make due entry thereof of sacraments conferred abroad?
Of places, however, otherwise mentioned in the register of former or
even at the time present homes of the parties in interest, as "San
Domingo," which occurs very often, or "Bucks County," that if not mis-
taken I have encountered only once, one only here seems noteworthy, the
first time, too, it is of record at St. Joseph's "Cape Henlopen" many
miles to the southward of Philadelphia, that may be found in the entry for
"June 9" the baptism by Father Ennis of a young woman, "Tabitha
Reddin [of] Cape Henlopen." Finally, as usual, it is to be observed that in
this register the baptisms are recorded of two (2) sets of twins, as well as
of seventeen (17) "illegitimates."
CORRECTION. In the Note preliminary to the Sacrum. Registers in the previous issue
(p. 318) is the statement based on Dr. Shea's Hist, (see references) that Rev. Charles
Whelan "presumably" died at Coffee Run in Delaware.
Since then we have received the following extract from the old church registers
of
Bohemia, in colonial days a mission-centre of the Faithful in that quarter of Maryland.
The extract reads thus: "1806. March 21. Died at the Head of Little Bohemia, the
Rev. Charles Whelan, of the Order of St. Francis, formerly Chaplain in the French Navy,
and lately Rector of White Clay Creek," [in Delaware.} Fr. Whelan then died at
Bohemia, at the age of about 65 years, where his remains were interred, (according to
our informant) near those of Rev. Stephen Faure close to the east end of Bohemia
church. (Inform, of Rev. E. I. Devitt, S. J., through courtesy of Mr. Joseph Willcox.)

himself for the bereavement by taking to his bosom a second, 
and even a third one, within the space of seven or eight years. 
About the middle of September of the year under review 
(1768) the Rector again paid a visit to this people, preached 
for them, administered the Lord's Supper, and endeavored, as 
usual, to "bring into order" the temporal as well as spiritual 
affairs of the two congregations. The business talents of this 
man of God were somewhat out of the usual way in the case 
of a rigidly trained and highly educated minister of the Gos-
pel, and are deserving of our notice. His organizing and ad-
ministrative faculties were scarcely less brilliant than his mental 
and spiritual endowments, which were of the superlative or-
der. His sense of proper order in all human relations, public 
and private, was a natural gift, and before the middle of his life 
it had been acutely developed by the circumstances of his po-
sition as President of Synod and supervisor of the German 
Lutheran churches of the Middle Colonies. He had marvel-
lous skill in unraveling tangled affairs, whether long-standing 
"accounts," or odious and never-ending church-quarrels, and 
possessed a competent knowledge of the legal forms needed for 
drawing documents relating to the rights and obligations of 
congregations and of individuals necessarily connected with 
them.

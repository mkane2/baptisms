Olde Ulster : an historical and genealogical magazine
Olde Ulster
prising the register of baptised children, that of
members received into communion, that of consis-
tories elected and that of marriages.
Below the above is a second entry which is thus
translated :
Which is continued in the year 1780 by the, at
that time, settled pastor, Lambertus De Ronde.
The explanation is that Mancius became the pastor
of the church in Kingston as associate of Domine Vas
and continued his pastoral charge of Katsbaan until
his death in 1762. Then the church of Katsbaan had
no settled pastor until the coming of DeRonde in 1780.
For the translation of the records from the Dutch
and the copy from which we print we would acknowl-
edge our debt to the courtesy of Miss Sarah Crispell
Bernard and Mrs. Mary Swart (Hoes) Burhans of the
City of Kingston, New York. It is our expectation to
give installments of both baptisms and marriages in
our monthly numbers.

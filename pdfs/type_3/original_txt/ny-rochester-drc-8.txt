COCHECTON
Have you seen the vale Cochecton, where the hemlock-
waters run,
When the mist is on the mountain, at the rising of the sun ?
There, like smiles of joyous woman, laughs the rippling
Delaware,
And the sunbeams kiss the wavelets, and the mists of upper
air.
There the light song of the raftsman echoes through the
vocal hills,
And the music of bright nature answers from the gushing
rills.
There the stag with scornful bearing, snuffs the perfume of
the breeze,
And the dew-drops sparkle brightly on the flowers and on
the trees.
Oh ! if there is peace 'neath Heaven, sure her calm abode
is here :
May my life flow ever onward, gentle stream, like thy
career.

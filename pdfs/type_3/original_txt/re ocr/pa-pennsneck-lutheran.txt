Whereas, the paper appears to be, too much blouting in the place,
hence I advice my worthy and kind successors to loock for the con­
tinuation of my Records, more forward, in this boock. I have pro­
posed it several times to the Vestry to purchase or get a new one; But
they have not, as yet complyed to my desire; But for [to] do them
justice I declare that the mean—reasonhath been, the want of cash or
monney, in this country, in our days. But we live in a good hope of
better times and then, hopefully, will this dessign be excuted; Mean­
while I must behelp myself with this boock, so, as I have found it,
and so as it is. And leave the satisfaction, to get a better one, to my
successor in the ministry, of these my dear Congregations.

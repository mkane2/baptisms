BAPTISMAL REGISTERS. 67
Registers is the fact that except in few instances baptisms were con-
ferred by Fr. Helbron, the only other officiating ministers thereof being
Frs. Goetz and La Grange. Again it seems to have been a not un-
usual fashion of Fr. Helbron, when inscribing the names of godparents
to set down in first place the man or woman after whom the subject
was called. (See the first three registrations for 1796. Other similar
instances will frequently be met with.) Moreover wherever the Chris-
tian names of parents are found coupled with an " and ", as
"
John and
Mary" So-and So the register shows that they were husband and
wife.
The Baptisms contained in this series of Holy Trinity registers
for the year 1796 number one hundred and nineteen including ten of
"
illegitimates
"
; for 1797, sixty including one "
illegitimate
" and one
pair of twins; for 1798, fifty-six including three "illegitimates" and
similarly one pair of twins ; and for the first eight months of 1799,
forty, a total number of 275 baptisms including fourteen
"
illegiti-
mates " and two pairs of twins.

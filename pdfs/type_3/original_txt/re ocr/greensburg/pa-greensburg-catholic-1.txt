entitled it the chapel of the Holy Cross. I intend next spring to
repair the other at Greensburg." Or again, March 29, 1802:
" My
dwelling place shall no more be called Sportsman's Hall but Clear
Spring near Greensburg."
Prince Gallitzin lived in Clearfield (they were neighbors, and
the best of neighbors, as a few letters of Father Helbron's show)
and Clear Spring was a literal translation of Helbron (Heller-Brun-
nen). The name, however, never became popular.
The other difficulty has already been mentioned, viz: Bofflo
(Boofflo) -Buffalo. I think the late Father Ganss was the first
who applied this Bofflo (Boofflo) to the well-known city in New
York State. But this is erroneous. It is true, Father Helbron says
in his letters that he travelled to the Indian settlements (Corn-
planters) and to the Lakes, but this Buffalo applied to a congregation
at Buffalo Creek (Armstrong Co., Pennsylvania). This, of course,
must change the deductions as to the family names in Greensburg
and Buffalo.

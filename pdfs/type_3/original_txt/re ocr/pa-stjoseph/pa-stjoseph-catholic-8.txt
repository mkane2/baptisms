his death, in April, eleven years later. In the baptismal entry of Mary
E. Clement, for June 19, (in this Register for 1794,) Father Elh'ng is
named as being in charge of "the congregation of Lancaster, Pa."
The sixth and only other missionary for this period at St. Joseph's was
Rev. Michael Ennis, who during his four years' residence as assistant is
represented as a worthy churchman in all respects. Of him little else is
known than that he came from Ireland this same year and died during
the yellow fever plague in 1798. In 1794 his name appears first in the
baptism of October 29.
The only other document perhaps in the country that refers to Father
Ennis, at least by name, is a petition of the year 1796, addressed to the
Augustinian authorities in Rome, Italy, by Father Philip Crane, a member
of that order, and at the time prior of their Irish hospice in the Eternal
City, known as St. Matthew in Merulana. Therein, Father Crane, speaking
in the interest of two of the brethren of the order at that time in the
United States, Rev. Matthew Carr, of Dublin, and Rev. John Rosseter, of
New Ross (in Ireland), solicits leave for them to establish a province of
the brotherhood in the country. With their names Father Crane couples
that of Father Ennis, whom he styles an upright ecclesiastic presbytero
omnibus numeris absolute who (he says) is engaged in mission work in
this country along with the other two.* Father Ennis, as observed, died
at St. Joseph's after four years' labor.
During the year 1794, four sets of twins were baptized at St. Joseph's;
and six children who were "illegitimate." T. C. M.

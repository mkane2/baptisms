driving their teams around the corner. Although the
open triangle was driven over every day in the year,
not one blundering wheel touched the interdicted stone
up to the year 1830. From my earliest recollection it
was called the "cursed stone," and the triangle was
familiarly known as the " cursed corner."

A SUNSET AT THE EPISCOPAL PARSONAGE
Sangerties
y
Saturday Evening, August ij, 1842
The weary sun is sinking in the West
—
Mantling the hill- tops with his fading light;
The clouds are floating o'er his couch of rest,
To join the sable pageantry of night:
Now from the bosom of the flowing stream
The tiny billows rise in gentle play
—
Casting aside in many a waving beam
The fading image of the god of day.
On hill and plain his light grows paler now,
And darkness slowly steals along the skies,
While calmly from the heavens o' ershadowed brow
Peep one by one, night's bright and countless eyes !
And into flowers whose buds have ope'd with day,
Falls through the air unseen, the dew-drop clear;
The winds that wantoned in the sun's warm ray,
Lisp in soft numbers that the night is near.

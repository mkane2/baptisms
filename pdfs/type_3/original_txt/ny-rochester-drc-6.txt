CHAMPLAIN
Columbia's banner rides thy flood :
Champlain ! thy boisterous tide is free
;
Again that banner's dipt in blood
;
It waves again in victory.
Champlain ! thine isles, thy craggy shore
Oft sleep beneath the thunder's shock
;
And many a bolt's explosive roar
Hath, harmless, on thy billow broke.
But when McDonough's fight begun.
His death-armed thunders, echoing sweep :
Reached all thy caves ; and every gun
—
Thine islands shook -, and rocked thy deep.
The flag of England's high renown
Marched proudly on thy mountain wave
—
McDonough brought its honors down,
And sank its glories in the grave !

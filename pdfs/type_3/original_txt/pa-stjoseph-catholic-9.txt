Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia
SACRAMENTAL REGISTERS. 203
("Renatus" in the Registers;) and so the handwriting of this missionary
has been deciphered by the late estimable chronicler of St. Joseph's,
Father Jordan, the Jesuit, in his reminiscences of that old shrine.*
'
Moreover Father Jordan notes that "Father Boudet had come to Phila-
delphia from San Domingo," a statement that is in no conflict with the
Register, wherein he himself has declared that he was "a priest from
France." (See Bapt. for "May 19.")
Other forms of Father Boudet 's name (as it appears in the Register) are
given by the translator as follows: "Proudez" or "Froudet,"once; "Prou-
det" or "Floudet," once; "Flaudet," twice; "Boudet" or "Houdet,"
four times; and "Boudet" simply eight times.
The place-names designated in the Register with the accompanying
statement of missionary visits thereto are noticeably fewer in comparison
with earlier years. The old-time mission-church of St. Joseph's seems to
have been now concentrating its energies in and in the immediate neighbor-
hood of Philadelphia. While its former out-missions (it also seems) were
getting resident clergymen of their own, or perhaps had been attached by
Bishop Carroll to other centers of the Faith.
In former Notes, it will be remembered, we have tracked our Philadelphia
apostles in many directions to even very many church "stations" through-
out Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.
During the present year (1795) only five places outside of town are named
as having been visited by city clergymen. They are four of them "old
familiar spots" to our readers: West Chester and Bucks County in Penn-
sylvania; Deerfield in New Jersey; and Wilmington (mis-written "Wilmen-
ton") in Delaware. The only new church-" station
"
for the year is
Egg Harbor in New Jersey, where on All Souls' Day (Nov. 2) Father Ennis
baptized John Dempsey, son of Bernard and his wife Mary Wier, the
god-parents of the two-months-old baby being Oliver Rhea and Catharine
Wintley, the earliest mention, if I mistake not, of Catholic residents in,
and the visit of a Catholic missionary to, that quarter of New Jersey.
Finally it may be noticed that the Register for this year (in its original
form) records the baptism of eighteen children designated as "illegitimate,"
-a stigma of dishonorable parentage however that, for reasons given
somewhat more in detail in a previous Note, is omitted in our transla-
tions here.
While of record, too, is the baptism of three sets of twins.

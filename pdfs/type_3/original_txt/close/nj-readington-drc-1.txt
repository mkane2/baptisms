READINGTON CHURCH BAPTISMS FROM 1720
[Note.—The Readington Reformed Church, formerly known as "The Church
over the North Branch," and the "North Branch Reformed Dutch Church,'' was
organized in 17 17, or 1718, and began separate worship in a log building Feb. 2t,
1719-20, located nearly opposite to the then residence of Andrew Ten Eyck (re-
cently that of the late Mr. John Vosseller), its first pastor being the Rev. Theo-
dorus J. Frelinghuysen. It was at this period collegiate with three other churches,
Raritan, Six-Mile Run and Three-Mile Run. In 1739 the building was abandoned
for a new frame building erected at Readington, about three miles west of the
former site. This latter building was used for ninety-four years, or until 1833,
when another church was built, and stood until 1864, at which time it was acci-
dentally burned down. The present church building dates from 1865. The pastor
have been as follows: Rev. T. J. Frelinghuysen, i720-'48: Rev. John Frelinghuy-
sen, i7SO-'54; Rev. Dr. Jacob R. Hardenbergh, I7s8-'8i ; Rev. Simeon Van Ars-
dalen, i783-'87; Rev. Peter Studdiford, 1787-1826; Rev. Dr. John Van Liew, 1828-
'69; Rev. Dr. J. G. Van Slyke, i869-'7o; Rev. John H. Smock, i87i-'83; Rev. B. V.
D. Wyckoff, 1884 to present. The early baptismal records of the church were ad-
mirably kept and in an excellent handw'riting, believed to have been that of Elbert
Stothoff. The record now given is from the copy made by the present pastor, Rev.
Mr. Wyckoff, by whose courtesy we are enabled to publish it.

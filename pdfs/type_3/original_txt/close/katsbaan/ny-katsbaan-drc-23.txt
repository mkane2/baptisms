THE PEACE OF WINNISOOK
In the verdant valleys rich with ripening maize,
Red men built their camp-fires in the olden days
;
But the white invader's unrelenting horde
Drove them from their wigwams with the torch and sword.
Backward to the forests over field and fen,
Far beyond the footprints and the haunts of men.
Thus the peaceful tribesmen, hunted like the deer,
Wandering through the highlands found a refuge here
;
Found their homes ancestral in their native hills,
Heard famiUar voices in the running rills,
Learned from Nature's lessons writ on vine and tree
That the Mighty Spirit made them brave and free.
Then the lordly chieftain, Winnisook the Great,
Gathered all his people to this vast estate,
And with words of wisdom, said with heat and force.
Like the waters rushing from their mountain source :
" Come and live contented in this safe retreat,
And, your woes forgetting, rest your weary feet
;

and whom we found, killed, tomahawked, scalped and
their heads cut off. lying on the ground where they had
their dance, flere we found one hundred and twenty
houses, all which we burnt, and destroyed ; their
canoes had been destroyed before we arrived there.
The army then returned, the enemy having fled to
Niagara, where, we afterwards heard, they suffered
greatly, man\- died. in short, our expedition was
their complete overthrtnv. On our return I went to
see Cayuga Lake, and lelumed to Newtown, when the
General sent me with a C(jma)and up the Tioga River
and passed tlie painted jjost, &c., and returned to
Newtown ; but the army had marched to a point
where I came up with them, and we proceeded to
Easton, when I was sent to Sussex and Warwick, then
through Pompton to Morristown, where we halted.
Colonel Gansevoort separated from the army near
Geneva and went to Albany. My regiment continued
at r\Iorristown all winter, first in tents, until the snow
was deej), before we got into huts, which we made of
lo-s.

To be conlifincd
AT IVhVNISOOK
On Time's untiring pinions
The Summer hours are borne
.\nd Nature's vast dominions
Await the Autumn's dawn.
AVhen o'er the regal mountains
The Oreads lead their throngs,
And all the forest fountains
Will sing their parting songs.
But here, while Summer lingers
Untouched by Winter's cold,
What though its frosty fingers
Tinge all the leaves with gold.
A genial glow of mildness
Will thrall the highland air,
And through the mountain wildness
A balmy fragrance bear.
So here we love to linger,
And hear the babbhng brook
Call to each feathered singer,
" Come back to Winnisook !
"

EXPLOSION OF STEAMER REINDEER
On the Hudson at Maiden, September ^th, 18^2
The beautiful Reindeer, a steamer of note
As any that on the bright waters float,
Has met with an awful disaster of late.
Surpassing in horror the Henry Clay' s fate.
While making her land, at the Maiden House dock,
She had a most awful explosion or shock,
And by this disaster, half a score were soon hurled.
Into a less happy or happier world.

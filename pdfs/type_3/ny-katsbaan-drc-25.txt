O I d e Ulster
Our neighbors in general have subscribed 2, some 3
bushels of wheat ; and George CUnton, Esq., has
offered to grind, bolt and pack all on free cost that
they will send to his mill (on Hudson's river) and it is
thought that there will be between 4 and 500 barrels
of flour sent from this [Ulster] county to Boston. {A
letter from Ulster county to a correspo7ident in Newport,

BURIAL OF THE MINNISINK
On sunny slope and beechen swell,
The shadowed light of evening fell
;
And, where the maple's leaf was brown,
With soft and silent lapse came down
The glory, that the wood receives
At sunset, in its golden leaves.
Far upward in the mellow light
Rose the blue hills. One cloud of white.
Around a far uplifted cone,
In the warm blush of evening shone
;
An image of the silver lakes,
By which the Indian's soul awakes.
But soon a luneral hymn was heard
Where the soft breath of evening stirred
The tall gray forest ; and a band
Of stern in heart, and strong in hand.
Came winding down beside the wave.
To lay the red chief in his grave.

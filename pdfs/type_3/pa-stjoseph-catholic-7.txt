a note of opprobrium, however, that finds no other

mention here in our translation of these ancient lists than the mere
avowal of the fact, not so very strange either in those days of political

times, so remarkable otherwise for their spirit of Christian heroism, for

their sacrifices for the Faith, that even then there were, backsliders

from the Christian and natural law of moral integrity, though not, it

must be allowed, very many in number, who unfortunately, the same as

now, were at times apt to bring reproach on the Christian name.

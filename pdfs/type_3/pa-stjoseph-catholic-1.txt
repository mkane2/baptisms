The letters L. C. that is, legitime conjugati, or lawfully married,
are often met with in the old registers, after the names of parents
or god-parents. They have been left out altogether in this
volume, principally because, while their mention in comparatively
but a few instances certifies no doubt to the fact that the parties
named were married, their absence or omission can in no manner
be taken to imply that the far greater number of parents and
others who are not so marked, were unmarried.

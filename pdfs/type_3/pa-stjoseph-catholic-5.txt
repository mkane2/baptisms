of the Faithful named therein : In Pennsylvania
in Chester county, then at 'Concord (doubtless the Willcox mansion
at Ivy Mills, in Delaware county), with Goshen in Lancaster county,
and Haycock and Warwick, in Bucks. In New Jersey at Charlotten-
burg, in the northern part of that state; Deerfield, in Salem county,
way down towards the south; then Greenwich in Cumberland, Mount
Hope in Morris, and Ringwood in Passaic. In Delaware we read
of visits to Christiana, New Castle, and Wilmington, by which very
likely was meant the ancient mission church of Our Lady St. Mary's,
of Coffee Run which at this time, it seems, was under the care of the
Augustinian Father John Rosseter, who, however, was maybe away
from his charge at the time.*
Of the places named in the registers, one only has defied our not
very insistent efforts, however, to determine its location. This is
"Hainsnert," as it appears to be spelled, mentioned once only, where,
on April eleventh, Father Graessl baptized one John Huber. Per-
haps it is merely a conjecture however "Hainsnert" was the family-
name of the persons visited by Father Graessl and not that of a
settlement.
In the registers, too, one will notice attached to the names of the
parties mentioned therein the several forms of religious belief pro-
fessed by them. Thus the terms "
Calvinist," or its abbreviated style,
"
Calv." ;
"
Presbyterian,"
"
Lutheran," and "
Quaker," of whom not
a few seem to have come back to the faith and good works of their
Mother.
Lastly, it should be observed in the translation of the proper names
of persons (from the Latin wherein all entries were made) the words
Jacobus and Maria have been usually rendered as
"
James
" and
"Mary" respectively, though the former may easily, at times, have
been set down by the missionaries, or their clerks, for Jacob. EDITOR.
